## Preface

I'm having a four-day break work, so I decided to finish the graphic algorithms convered in **Introduction to Algorithm**. They are the last part of this book. Throuthout my study, I plan to document this learning journey step by step, highlighting crucial concepts, and noting down all chanllenging and uncertain aspects for future review.

## Basics

### Representations of graphs

There are two types of graphs: directed and undirected, and for both of them, we can use a collection of adjacency lists or an adjacency matrix.

Let's say V stands for vertices and E stands for edges so a graph G=(V,E). The number of V is \|V\| and so on E. If \|E\| is much less than \|V\|^2, a collection of adjacency lists is a better choice and otherwise, if \|E\| is close to \|V\|^2 an adjacency matrix is better.

### Breadth-first search(BFS)

Given a vertex S in a graph G=(V,E), breadth-first search expolores all the rest of the vertices that are reachable to S systematically. This algorithm works on both directed and undirected graphs. Starting from source S, the algorithm first discovers all its neighbors and continues to use each neighbor as a new source to repeat this process until all vertices are found.

We use colors to keep track of the BFS: white means the vertex is never found, gray means it's in process which is also called frontier, and black means it has been discovered.

Breath=first search constructs a breadth-first tree, whenever the search discovers a white vertex V in the course of scanning the adjacency list of a gray vertex U, the vertex V and the edge (U,V) are added to the tree. We say that U is the **predecessor** or **parent** of V in the breadth-first tree, and each reachable vertex from S has exactly one parent except the source S. If U is on the simple path in the tree from the root to vertex V, them U is an ancestor of V and V is a descendant of U.

```java
BFS(G,S)
    for each vertex U belongs to G.V-S // all vertices but S
        U.color == WHITE
        U.d = -1 // means infinity
        U.P = NIL
    S.color = GRAY
    S.d = 0
    S.P = NIL
    Q = EMPTY;
    ENQUEUE(Q,S)
    whilc Q != EMPTY
        U = DEQUEUE(Q)
        for each vertex V in G.Adj[U]  //search the neighbors of U
            if V.color == WHITE        // is V being discovered first?
                V.color = GRAY
                V.d = U.d + 1;
                V.P = U
                ENQUEUE(Q,V)          // V is no on the frontier.
        U.color = BLACK               // U is behind the frontier.
```

* **V.color** is the color of V: WHITE, GRAY, or BLACK.
* **V.d holds** the distance from the source vertex S to V, as computed by the algorithm.
* **V.P** is V's predecessor in the breath-first tree. If V has no predecessor then V.P = NIL.

Define the shortest-path distance ùõÖ(S,V) from S to V as the minimum number of edges in any path from vertex S to vertex V.

* Let G=(V,E) be a directed or undirected graph, and let S belongs to V be an arbitrary vertex. Then, for any edge (U,V) belongs to E: ùõÖ(S,V) <= ùõÖ(S,U) + 1.

* Let G=(V,E) be a directed or undirected graph, and suppose that BFS is run on G from a given source vertex S belongs to V. Then, for each vertex V belongs to V, the value V.d computed by BFS satifies V.d >= ùõÖ(S,V) at all times, including at termination.

* Suppose that during the execution of BFS on a graph G=(V,E), the queue Q contains the verices <V1,V2,V3...Vr>, where V1 is the head of Q and Vr is the tail. Then, Vr.d <= V1.d + 1 and Vi.d <=V(i+1).d for i=1,2,...,r-1.

* Suppose that vertices Vi and Vj are enqueued during the execution of BFS, and that Vi is enqueued before Vj. Then Vi.d<=Vj.d at the time that Vj is enqueued.

* Let G=(V,E) be a directed or undirected graph, and suppose that BFS is run on G from a given vertex s belongs to V. Then, during its execution, BFS discovers every vertex v belongs to V that is reachable from the source s, and upon termination, v.d = ùõÖ(S,V) for all v belongs to V. Moreover, for any vertex v!= s that is reachable from s, one of the shortes paths from s to v is a shortes path from s to v.P followed by the edge (v.P,V).

#### Predecessor subgraph

GP = (VP,EP) of G=(V,E), where

VP = {v belongs to V:VP!=NIL} and {S}
EP = {(vP,v):v belongs to VP-{S}}

\|EP\| = \|VP\|-1

* When applied to a directed or undirected graph G=(V,E), prodcedure BFS constructs P so that the predecessor subgrapth GP=(VP,EP) is a breadth-first tree.

The PRINT-PATH procedure prints out the vertices on a shortest path from s to v provided that BFS has already construted a breadth-first tree.

```java
PRINT-PATH(G,s,v)
    if v==s
        print s
    elseif v.P == NILL
        print "no path from so to v exists"
    else PRINT-PATH(G,s,v.P)
        print v
```

### Depth-first search

```java
DFS(G)
    for each vertex u belongs to G.V
        u.color = WHITE
        u.P = NIL
    time = 0 //gloabl time counter
    for each vertex u belongs G.V
        if u.color == WHITE
            DFS-VISIT(G,u)

DFS-VISIT(G,u)
    time = time + 1
    u.d = time
    u.color = GRAY
    for each vertex v in G.Adj[u]
        if v.color == WHITE
            v.P = u
            DFS-VISIT(G,v)
    time = time + 1
    u.f = time
    u.color = BLACK
```

* **u.d** is when the first time this vertex is found.
* **u.f** records when the search finishes examining u's adjacency list.
* u.d and u.f are integers between 1 and 2\|V\|.
* u.d < u.f
* Vertex u is WHITE before time u.d, GRAY between time u.d and time u.f, and BLACK thereafter.
* DFS supports both undirected and directed graphs.

#### Properties of Depth-first Search

In any depth-first search of a (directed or undirected) graph G = (V,E), for any two vertices u and v, exactly one of the following tree conditions holds:

* the intervals [u.d,u.f] and [v.d,v.f] are entirely disjoint, and neither u nor v is a descendant of the other in the depth-first forest.

* the interval [u.d,u.f] is contained entirely within the interval[v.d,v.f], and u is a descendant of v in a depth-first tree, or

* the interval [v.d,v.f] is contained entirely within the interval [u.d,u.f], and v is a descendant of u in a depth-first tree.

* Vertex v is a proper decendant vertex u in the depth-first forest for a (directed or undirected) graph G if and only if u.d < v.d < v.f < u.f.

* In a depth-first forest of a (directed or undirectd) graph G=(V,E), vertex v is a descendant of vertext u if and only if at the time u.d that the search discovers u, there is a path from u to v consisting entirely of white vertices.

#### Classification of edges

The depth-first forest GP produced by a depth-first on graph G an contain four types of edges:

1. **Tree edges** are edges in the depth-first forest GP. Edge(u,v) is a tree edge if v was first discovered by exploring edge(u,v).

2. **Bach edges** are those edges(u,v) connecting a vertex u to an ancestor v in a depth-first tree. We consider self-loops, which may occur in directed graphs, to be back edges.

3. **Forward edges** are those nontree edges(u,v) connecting a vertex u to a proper descendant v in a depth-first tree.

4. **Cross edges** are all other edges. They can go between vertices in the same depth-first tree, as long as one vertex is not an ancestor of the other, or they can go between vertices in different depth-first trees.

The key idea is that when an edge(u,v) is first explored, the color of vertex v says something about the edge:

1. WHITE indicates a tree edge,
2. GRAY indicates a back edge, and
3. BLACK indicates a forward or cross edge. An edge(u,v) is a forward edge if u.d < v.d and a cross edge if u.d > v.d.

* In a depth-first search of an **undirected** graph G, every edge of G is either a tree edge or a back edge.

### Topological sort

DAG: directed acyclic graph.

```java
TOPOLOGICAL-SORT(G)
    call DFS(G) to compute finish times v.f for each vertex v as each vertex is finished, insert it onto the front of a linked list.
    return the linked list of vertices.
```

* A directed graph G is acyclic if and only if a depth-first search of G yields no back edges.

* TOPOLOGICAL-SORT produces a topological sort of the directed acyclic graph provided as its input.

### Strongly connected components

A strongly connected component of a directed graph G=(V,E) is a maximal set of vertices C belongs to V such that for every pair of vertices u,v belong to C, both u~>v and v~>u, that is, vertices u and v are reachable from each other.

The transpose of G is used to find the strongly connected components of G.

GT = (V,ET), where ET = {(u,v):(v,u) belongs to E}. ET consists of the edges of G with their directions **reversed**.

A key property of the component graph G-SCC = (V-SCC,E-SCC) : Suppose that G has strongly connected components C1,C2...Ck. The vertex set V-SCC is {v1,v2,...,vk}, and it contains one vertex vi for each strongly connected component Ci of G. there is an edge (vi,vj) belongs to E-SCC. 

It's not easy to understand this property, but there is a digram to explian this well. (c) is the component graph we are talking about here.

![component graph](/assets/image/strongly-connected-graph.png)

```java
STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS(G)
    call DFS(G) to compute finish times u.f for each vertex u
    create GT
    call DFS(GT), but in the main loop of DFS, consider the vertices in order of decreasing u.f
    out put the vertices of each tree in the depth-first forest formed in last step as a separate strongly connected component.
```

* Let C and C' be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph G = (V,E), let u,v beong to C, let u',v'belong to C', and suppose that G contains a path u~>u'. THe G cannot also contain a path v'~>v.

The notation for discovery and finish times extends to sets of vertices. For a subset U of vertices, d(U) and f(U) are the earliest discovery time and latest finish time, repectively, of any vertex in U:d(U)=main{u.d:u belongs to U} and f(U) = max{u.f:u belongs to U}.

* Let C and C' be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph G = (V,E). Suppose that there is an edge(u,v) belongs to E, where u belongs to C' and v belongs to C. Then f(C')>f(C).

* Let C and C' be distinct strongly connected components in directed graph G = (V,E), and suppose that f(C)>f(C'). Then ET contains no edge(v,u) such that u belongs to C' and v belong to C.

* The STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS procedure correctly computes the strongly connected components of the directed graph G provided as its input.

## Minimum Spanning Trees

For an undirected graph G = (V,E), and for each edge(u,v) belongs E, a wight w(u,v) specifis the cost to connect u and v. The goal is to find an acyclic subset T belongs to E that connects all of the vertices and whos total wgight is minimized:

w(T) = w1(u1,v1)+w2(u2,v2)+...+(wr,vr), for each (ui,vi) belongs to T.

### Growing a minimum spanning tree

```java
GENERIC-MST(G,w)
    A = EMPTY
    while A does not form a spanning tree
        find an edge(u,v) that is safe for A
        A = A merge {(u,v)}
    return A
```

The generic method manages a set of A of edges, which grows the minimum spanning tree one edge at a time, maintaining the following loop invariant:

**Prior to each iteration, A is a subset of some minimum spanning tree.**

The tricky part is, of course, finding a safe edge.

#### definitions

* **cut(S,V-S):** A cut(S,S-V) of an undirected graph G=(V,E) is a partition of V.
* **cross:** We say that an edge(u,v) belongs to E crosses the cut(S,V-S) if one of its endpoints belongs to S and the other belongs to V-S.
* A cut **respects** a set A of edges if no edge in A crosses the cut.
* A edge is a **light edge** crossing a cut if its weight is the minimum of any edge corssing the cut. More generally, we say that an edge is a light edge satisfying a given property if its weight is the minimum of any edge satisfying the property.

#### A Theorem

* Let G=(V,E) be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w defined on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, let (S,S-V) be any cut of G that respects A, and let (u,v) be a light edge crossing (S,S-V). Then, edge (u,v) is safe for A.

#### A Corollary

Let G=(V,E) be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function w defined on E. Let A be a subset of E that is included in some minimum spanning tree for G, and let C=(Vc,Ec) be a connected component(tree) in the forest GA = (V,A). If (u,v) is a light edge connecting C to some other component in GA, then (u,v) is safe for A.

### The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim

#### Kruskal's algorithm

```java
MST-KRUSKAL(G,w)
    A = EMPTY
    for each vertex v belong to G.V
        MAKE-SET(v)
    create a single list of the edges in G.E
    sort the list of edges into monotonically increasing order by weight w
    for each edge (u,v) taken from the sored list in order
        if FIND-SET(u) != FIND-SET(v)
            A = A merge {(u,v)}
            UNION(u,v)
    return A
```

#### Prim's algorithm

```java
MST-PRIM(G,w,r)
    for each vertex u belongs to G.V
        u.key = infinity
        u.P = NIL
    r.key = 0
    Q = EMPTY
    for each vertex u belongs to G.V
        INSERT(Q,u)
    while Q is not EMPTY
        u = EXTRACT-MIN(Q)
        for each vertex v in G.Adj[u]
            if v belongs to Q and w(u,v)<v.key
                v.P = u
                v.key = w(u,v)
                DECREASE-KEY(Q,v,w(u,v))
```

* r is the root of the minimum spanning tree.
* v.key is the minimum weight of any edge connecting v to a vertex in the tree.
* v.P manes the parent of v in the tree.

## Single-Source Shortest Paths

Given a graph G=(V,E), find a shortest path from a given **source vertex** s belongs to V to every vertex v belongs to V.

* Given a weighted, directed graph G=(V,E) with weight function w: E->R, let p=<v0,v1...,vk> be a shortest path from vertex v0 to vertex vk and , for any i and j such that 0<=i<=j<=k, let pij = <vi,v(i+1),....,vj> be the subpath of p from vertex vi to vertext vj. Then pij is a shortest path from vi to vj.

A shortest path cannot contain a negative-weight cycle. Nor can it contain a positive-weight cycle, since removing the cycle from the path produces a path with the same source and destination vertices and a lower path weight. You can also remove a 0-weight cycle from any path to produce another path whose weihgt is the same. Therefore, that any sortest path contains at most \|V\|-1 edges.

A **shortest-paths tree** rooted at s is a directed subgraph G'=(V',E'), where V' belongs to V and E' belong E, such that:

1. V' is the set of vertices reachable from s in G,
2. G' forms a rooted tree with root s, and 
3. for all v belongs to V', the unique simple path from s to v in G' is a shortest path from s to v in G.

Shortest paths are not necessarily unique, and neither are shortest path trees.

```java
INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G,s)
    for each vertex v belongs to G.V
        v.d = infinity
        v.P = NIL
    s.d = 0
```
 * v.d is an upper bound on the weight of a shortest path from source s to v. We call v.d a **shortest-path estimate**.

 ```java
 RELEAX(u,v,w)
    if v.d > u.d + w(u,v)
        v.d = u.d + w(u,v)
        v.P = u
 ```

 * **Triangle inequality:** For any edge(u,v) belongs to E, we have ùõÖ(s,v) <= ùõÖ(s,u) + w(u,v)
 * **Upper-bound property:** We always have v.d>=ùõÖ(s,v) for all vertices v belongs to V, and once v.d achives the value ùõÖ(s,v), it never changes.
 * **No-path property:** If there is no path from s to v, then we always have v.d=ùõÖ(s,v)=infinity
 * **Convergence property:** If s~u->v is a shortest path in G for some u,v belong to v, and if u.d = ùõÖ(s,u) at any time prior to relaxing edge (u,v), then v.d=ùõÖ(s,v) at all times afterward.
 * **Path-relaxation property:**If p=<v0,v1,...vk> is a shortest path from s=v0 to vk, and the deges of p relaxed in the order (v0,v1),(v1,v2)...(v(k-1),vk), then vk.d=ùõÖ(s,vk).
 * **Predeccssor-subgraph property:** Once v.d=ùõÖ(s,v) for all v belongs to V, the predecessor subgraph is shortest-paths tree rooted at s.

### The Bellman-Ford algorithm


 ```java
 BELLMAN-FORD(G,w,s)
    INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G,s)
    for i = 1 to |G.V|-1
        for each edge(u,v) belongs to G.E
            RELAX(u,v,w)
    for each edge(u,v) belongs to G.E
        if v.d > u.d + w(u,v)
            return FALSE
    return TRUE
 ```

 The algorithm returns TRUE if and only if the graph contains no negative-weight cycles that are reachable from the source.

### Single-source shortest paths in directed acyclic graphs

```java
DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS(G,w,s)
    topologically sort the vertices of G
    INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G,s)
    for each vertex u belongs to G.V, taken in topologically sorted order
        for each vertex in G.Adj[u]
            RELAX(u,v,w)
```

### Dijkstra's algorithm

Given a weighted directed graph G=(V,E): w(u,v)>=0 for each edge(u,v) belongs to E.

```java
DIJKSTRA(G,w,s)
    INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G,s)
    S = EMPTY
    Q = EMPTY
    for each vertex u belongs to G.V
        INSEART(Q,u)
    while Q!=EMPTY
        u = EXTRACT-MIN(Q)
        S = S merge {u}
        for each vertex v in G.Adj[u]
            RELAX(u,v,w)
            if the call of RELAX decreased v.d
                DECREASE-KEY(Q,v,v.d)
```

**Q** is a min-prority queue Q of vertices, keyed by their d values.

## The end

I think it's enough for my work, and maybe later I'll continue this.
