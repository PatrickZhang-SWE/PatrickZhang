I always complain how little time I have, that don't have time to do what I want to do. 2025 New Year holiday starts from tomorrow and ends on 6th, Jan 2025. It's total 9 days. 9 days of time is at my dispose. I want to do two challenges during these 9 days:
1. Learn Vim.
2. Re-learn Japanese basic grammar and put them into Anki.
Only two things, no more. 

## Vim Learning
I tried too many time to remember learning Vim. I know how to use Vim in a very basic way: how to open a file, change something, simple copys and pastes and so on. When it comes to use Vim as a tool to code, my Vim knowledge can't handle it.
I am a Java developer. Normally, it's enough to use the IDEA but I want to trun my focus on Linux kernel development so using Vim to do it is a more normal way. 
Base on above, the goal of this Vim learning is simple: Enough Vim knowledge for coding.
I'm planning to learn it in this way: 
1. Using the book `Practical Vim` as the main material.
2. Put all the tips in the book into Anki for reviews.
3. Practice it by reading and changing linux kernal code.(without using mouse)

## Japanese Basic Grammar
If I remember right, this will be the third time leaning Japanse basic grammar(N4~N5). Basically, everytime I leran the grammar, situation like this happens: forgeting what I learned before and getting impacitent. This time I want to add one more step to stop this: using Anki to do the reviews.

## Last day review

### Vim Learning

I've read `Practical Vim` again but skipped the last two charpters and put most used command into Anki. Later, I'll continue to use Anki for reviewing and remembering.

I spent sometime on studying lazyvim for neovim, which is pretty good. I plan to use this as my default IDE in the future.

### Japanese Basic Grammar

Didn't go through all of it but put the verbe conjugations into Anki for later reviewing.

Overall, most of my time didn't spend on these two things but I can say I didn't waste this holiday.
